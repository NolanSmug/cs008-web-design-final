            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>While the exact origin and creation of the guitar is disputed, it is known that Spain
                had instruments called guitars by the year 1200, although these guitars are thought 
                to be slightly different in shape and functionality than the guitars of the modern era. 
                Into the 1600s and 1700s, the baroque guitar, thought to be a predecessor to the modern 
                classical guitar, was widely used. The structure of the  modern guitar would later be 
                finalized by Spanish guitar maker Antonio Torres Jurado, who changed aspects about the 
                guitar's shape and form that we see in guitars today.

            <h2>Acoustic Guitar</h2>
            <p>The acoustic guitar, while maybe less famous than its electric counterpart, uses a 
                "sound box" design that allows the sound to be naturally enhanced without needing 
                amplifiers or speakers. Many of the most skilled guitarists of all time specialize 
                in this type of guitar and have made decades-long careers out of it.</p>

            <h2>Electric Guitar</h2>
            <p>While many other types of guitars exist, one of the most famous types, without a doubt, 
                is the electric guitar. Used in a wide variety of genres spanning all the way from jazz
                to rock and everything in between, it is used by many skilled musicians in many different 
                types of music. Unlike the acoustic guitar, it usually must be connected to an amplifier 
                to be heard at the same volumes as the acoustic guitar. We are able to achieve this from what
                are known as pickups, which electronically convert the string vibration into a sound. This allows 
                an electric guitar's sound to be altered in real time more easily than an acoustic guitar, allowing 
                for (arguably) greater freedom in musical style.
